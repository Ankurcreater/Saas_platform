in drizzle we use neon PostGresql and needed db_url to get this 

we go to neon console and create new project


after that we create drizzle.config.js from drizzle and drizzle-kit setup 

after that we created db.js for database and create schema.js for neon database

after that we set up studio,push in package.json
studio shows our table type npm run db:studio
push pushes the changes to table npm run db:push
